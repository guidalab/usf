               <h3>STING Pathway Modulation</h3>
                <p><i>Our STING research focuses on developing novel small-molecule modulators to fine-tune STING activity, offering potential therapeutic avenues for these conditions.</i></p>
                In our laboratory, we are at the forefront of investigating the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, a critical component of innate immunity that responds to cytosolic DNA threats, such as those from viral infections or cellular damage. Dysregulation of STING can lead to excessive inflammation, contributing to autoimmune diseases, cytokine storms (e.g., in COVID-19), and other inflammatory disorders.
                <p>A landmark achievement is the discovery of clonixeril (CXL), a non-nucleotide compound identified as the most potent human STING (hSTING) modulator to date. Published in ACS Central Science (2025), our work reveals CXL's dual-mode interaction: it acts as a weak agonist at concentrations above 1 nM but exhibits unprecedented antagonistic effects at sub-femtomolar levels (down to 100 attomolar, or 10⁻¹⁸ M). This inverse dose-response behavior, where lower doses yield stronger inhibition, challenges conventional pharmacology and highlights CXL's unique mechanism.
                </p><p>We employed advanced computational approaches, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of equilibrated hSTING models (agonist and antagonist conformations), to screen compound libraries like the NCI Diversity Set. Virtual docking and pharmacophore-based screening pinpointed CXL, which we validated through a multi-tiered experimental pipeline:
                </p>
                <p>Cellular Assays: In THP-1 monocytic cells using an IRF3 luciferase reporter, CXL potently inhibited STING-mediated interferon production when competing with agonists like 2',3'-cGAMP or diABZI3. In HEK293 cells, it suppressed 2',3'-cGAMP-induced STING phosphorylation (at Ser366) and IFN-β expression, reducing levels by over 50% even at 1 femtomolar.
                </p><p>Biophysical Characterization: Techniques such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), microscale thermophoresis (MST), dynamic light scattering (DLS), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and fluorescence microscopy confirmed CXL's binding and its disruption of STING oligomerization—a key step in pathway activation. MST revealed an EC₅₀ below 1 femtomolar in competition assays, while DLS showed CXL alters oligomer formation in the presence of 2',3'-cGAMP.
                </p>
                <p>Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on CXL analogs, including clonixin (its carboxylic acid precursor) and mefenamic acid derivatives, underscored the specificity of CXL's ester moiety for ultra-potent activity. Unlike known antagonists, CXL's attomolar potency suggests it may stabilize inhibitory conformations or interfere with higher-order STING assemblies.
                This breakthrough not only expands our understanding of STING regulation but also paves the way for ultra-low-dose therapeutics to mitigate hyperactive immune responses. Ongoing efforts in our lab include optimizing CXL derivatives for clinical translation and exploring their efficacy in disease models. For more details, see our publication: Sparks et al., ACS Cent. Sci. 2025, 11, 994–1008.
